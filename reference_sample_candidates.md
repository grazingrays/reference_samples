- preparation: involves spin-coating of sheet-like
  particles. Reproducibility needs to be ensured.

### Iron Oxide Nanoparticles with Polymer on Si 

- commercial [verification sample for GISAXS](https://mystore.malvernpanalytical.com/mystore/s/de/product/verif-sample-gisaxs/01t0Y000006V5IFQA0) by Malvern 
  + price?
- pro: no sample preparation necessary
- con: sample preparation process probably not disclosed, would
  require verification of reproducibility

### Polystyrene Particles on Si 

- in-house experiments at BAM based on PS particles sold as light
  scattering standard
  + spin-coating upon dilution in ethanol to reduce interfacial tension 
    + PS particles: 100 nm diameter *to do: look up product name*
    + dilution 1:20 with ethanol
    + 1 h ultrasonic bath
    + spin-coating: add 120 microliters to wafer, 2000 rpm, 1000 rpm/s acceleration, 3 min total time
- pro: 
  + commercial nanoparticles, different sizes available
  + scattering contrast w.r.t. silicon for both neutrons and x-rays
- con: 
  + homogeneity of film to be determined 
  + particles not strongly attached to surface (try melting?)
  + more difficult for smaller particles

### Line Gratings 

- used by [PTB](https://www.ptb.de/cms/en.html), see Wernecke et al.

  + test measurements at BAM will be possible with 100 nm and 250 nm
    distance gratings 
- pro: 
  + well-studied scattering
  + robust sample 
  + sensitive to all three angles 
- con: 
  + needs aligning in all three directions
  + sample preparation cannot be done in-house 
  + far away from a typical sample 

### Mesoporous Silica Films 

- idea: porous films as the inverse of particles on a surface, but
  with easier-to-measure critical angle of the film. Could be useful
  for complementary reflectometry measurements. 
- pro: 
  + short-range order and suitable size range (Sachse et al.;test GISAXS at BAM)

  + interest in developing a reference material like this at BAM - could then be bought
- con:
  + reference material development in the very early stages (years
    still needed)
